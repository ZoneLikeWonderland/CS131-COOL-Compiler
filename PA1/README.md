# Get Started

To get started, please simply fork this GitLab repository and follow the submissions guidelines below.
For further information, please refer to the PDF description on Piazza.
**Remember to change your repo to a private one before you commit to it.**


# Submit

You should check in `src/cool.flex` to Gitlab.

First, make a commit and push your own `src/cool.flex`. From the root of this repo, run:

```shell
git add src/cool.flex
git commit -m"{Your commit message}"
git push origin master
```

Then add a tag to request grading on your current submission:

```shell
git tag {tagname} && git push origin {tagname}
```

Beware that all of your tag names should be distinguished among one project repo. Therefore, remember to use **a new tag name** `{tagname}` in each submission.

Every submission will create a new Gitlab issue, where you can track the progress.
